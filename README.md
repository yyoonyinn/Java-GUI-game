# Java-GUI-game

I and my friends created this game in December 2019. 
We used these knowledge from Paradigm subject such as Object-oriented, Exception handling, Thread, GUI, Event-driven in Java.

This game is called “Is Christmas coming to town?”.  Our Team(4 people) developed a mini game with GUI in Java. 
The concept of game is like a ladder and snake game, you can choose to be a Santa player or a Grinch player, so you can play alone with our Bot or play with your friend too. 

The players will take turns to roll dice by pressing Spacebar(Be a Santa) or Enter(Be a Grinch) and your character will be moved automatically, the winner is the player who firstly goes to END square. If Santa is a winner, Christmas will happen. But if Grinch is a winner, Christmas can’t happen.



P.S. If you are interested in our game and want to run it, you have to run in firstpage.java file because it has a main method.
