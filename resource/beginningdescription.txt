Santa -> My name is Santa Claus. I have to give presents to children in this town on the night of Christmas Eve.

Grinch -> My name is Grinch. I hate the noise of Christmas. So, I will do every way to steal Christmas.

Narrate -> Before the early morning hours of 25th December, Santa has to arrive in the town for giving gifts so that Christmas has happened in this town.
But if Grinch has arrived before Santa, Christmas would not happen.
